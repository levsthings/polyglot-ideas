# Cat

#### Description:

Create a program that mimics the UNIX utility `cat` with limited functionality.

#### Behavior:

-   Users should be able to call the program via terminal like `mycat readme.md` providing a single argument containing a valid path to a filename.
-   Your program should try to read the file and if successful, it should print the contents to standard output.
-   If the user provides a file that does not exist, the program should let the user know and quit.
